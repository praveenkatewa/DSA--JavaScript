//* "Addition" 
// *to ckeck type of variable the use typeof

let a =10;
let b=20;
console.log(a+b)
console.log(typeof(a+b))  //*number



//* "concatenation"

let c=30;
let d="40";   //* string
console.log(c+d)
console.log(typeof(c+d)) //* string

//* in console when ans in black is string and in blue then number

// * operands --> In JavaScript, operands are the values or variables on which operators perform actions.
// *ex - 5+7 =12  here 5,7 are operands and + is operator



// console.log("sum of 10 and 20 " + a+ b)
//* ans sum of 10 and 20 1020  --->  here the use of operator so sum of 10 and 20 work as operands ,and it output come as string  . .it work as concatenation

// * right way to write
// console.log("sum of two number 10 and 20 is " +(a+b))
//* ans---> sum of two number 10 and 20 is 30

// * here first (10+20 ) it is number then it add to string and concatenation


// * but if use a+b in first

console.log(a+b+ "is sum of 10 and 20")
// *ans 30is sum of 10 and 20
